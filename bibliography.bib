	abstract = {In serverless computing, each function invocation is executed in a container (or a Virtual Machine), and container cold startup results in long response latency. We observe that some functions suffer from cold container startup, while the warm containers of other functions are idle. Based on the observation, other than booting a new container for a function from scratch, we propose to alleviate the cold startup by re-purposing a warm but idle container from another function. We implement a container management scheme, named Pagurus, to achieve the purpose. Pagurus comprises an intra-function manager for replacing an idle warm container to be a container that other functions can use without introducing additional security issues, an inter-function scheduler for scheduling containers between functions, and a sharingaware function balancer at the cluster-level for balancing the workload across different nodes. Experiments using Azure serverless traces show that Pagurus alleviates 84.6\% of the cold startup, and the cold startup latency is reduced from hundreds of milliseconds to 16 milliseconds if alleviated.},

	abstract = {Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a powerful paradigm for scalable data management that is employed in many real-world scenarios such as detecting credit card fraud in banks. The so-called complex events are expressed using a specification language that is typically implemented and executed on a specific runtime system. While the tight coupling of these two components has been regarded as the key for supporting CEP at high performance, such dependencies pose several inherent challenges as follows. (1) Application development atop a CEP system requires extensive knowledge of how the runtime system operates, which is typically highly complex in nature. (2) The specification language dependence requires the need of domain experts and further restricts and steepens the learning curve for application developers.In this paper, we propose CEPless, a scalable data management system that decouples the specification from the runtime system by building on the principles of serverless computing. CEPless provides "operator as a service" and offers flexibility by enabling the development of CEP application in any specification language while abstracting away the complexity of the CEP runtime system. As part of CEPless, we designed and evaluated novel mechanisms for in-memory processing and batching that enable the stateful processing of CEP operators even under high rates of ingested events. Our evaluation demonstrates that CEPless can be easily integrated into existing CEP systems like Apache Flink while attaining similar throughput under high scale of events (up to 100K events per second) and dynamic operator update in 238 ms.},

The limited resources of densely distributed fog nodes call for their efficient use by hosted applications and services. To address this challenge, and the needs of different application scenarios, this paper proposes a serverless platform for edge computing.

	abstract = {FaaS allows an application to be decomposed into functions that are executed on a FaaS platform. The FaaS platform is responsible for the resource provisioning of the functions. Recently, there is a growing trend towards the execution of compute-intensive FaaS functions that run for several seconds. However, due to the billing policies followed by commercial FaaS offerings, the execution of these functions can incur significantly higher costs. Moreover, due to the abstraction of underlying processor architectures on which the functions are executed, the performance optimization of these functions is challenging. As a result, most FaaS functions use pre-compiled libraries generic to x86-64 leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we examine the underlying processor architectures for Google Cloud Functions (GCF) and determine their prevalence across the 19 available GCF regions. We modify, adapt, and optimize three compute-intensive FaaS workloads written in Python using Numba, a JIT compiler based on LLVM, and present results wrt performance, memory consumption, and costs on GCF. Results from our experiments show that the optimization of FaaS functions can improve performance by 12.8x (geometric mean) and save costs by 73.4\% on average for the three functions. Our results show that optimization of the FaaS functions for the specific architecture is very important. We achieved a maximum speedup of 1.79x by tuning the function especially for the instruction set of the underlying processor architecture.},

	abstract = {Scientific workflows are typically data- and compute-intensive. They consist of many stages, each of which may contain hundreds to even thousands of tasks. Traditionally, scientific workflows have been executed using the serverful computing model. Serverless computing presents an attractive alternative to the serverful computing model as it frees developers from managing and provisioning resources and offers a fine-grained pay-as-you-go pricing model. In this paper, we investigate the viability of using serverless computing to execute scientific workflows. Specifically, we discuss, implement, and evaluate three orchestration approaches for executing scientific workflows: serverful-centralized, serverless-centralized, and serverless-decentralized. This work is the first to implement and evaluate a purely serverless orchestration approach that does not require deploying a dedicated workflow manager. Our evaluation shows that serverless orchestration approaches cause a noticeable performance overhead for some workflow patterns (e.g., reduce stages) due to accessing a large amount of remote data. We propose two optimizations (i.e., prefetching file privileges and container placement) that exploit data locality to mitigate that impact. Our evaluation with the Montage application shows that a fully decentralized approach achieves a comparable performance to a serverful approach. Also, our results show that prefetching file privileges and container placement optimizations improve the performance by 26\% and 44\% respectively when compared to an unoptimized version.},

	abstract = {Serverless computing (Function-as-a-Service) provides fine-grain resource sharing by running functions (or Lambdas) in containers. Data-dependent functions are required to be invoked following a pre-defined logic, which is known as serverless workflows. However, our investigation shows that the traditional master-worker based workflow execution architecture performs poorly in serverless context. One significant overhead results from the master-side workflow schedule pattern, with which the functions are triggered in the master node and assigned to worker nodes for execution. Besides, the data movement between workers also reduces the throughput. To this end, we present a worker-side workflow schedule pattern for serverless workflow execution. Following the design, we implement FaaSFlow to enable efficient workflow execution in the serverless context. Besides, we propose an adaptive storage library FaaStore that enables fast data transfer between functions on the same node without through the database. Experiment results show that FaaSFlow effectively mitigates the workflow scheduling overhead by 74.6\% on average and data transmission overhead by 95\% at most. When the network bandwidth fluctuates, FaaSFlow-FaaStore reduces the throughput degradation by 23.0\%, and is able to multiply the utilization of network bandwidth by 1.5𝑋 -4𝑋 .},

Recently, a new type of serverless infrastructures has emerged, represented by such services as Google Cloud Functions and AWS Lambda, also referred to as the Function-as-a-Service model. In this paper we take a look at such serverless infrastructures, which are designed mainly for processing background tasks of Web and Internet of Things applications, or event-driven stream processing. We evaluate their applicability to more compute- and data-intensive scientific workflows and discuss possible ways to repurpose serverless architectures for execution of scientific workflows. We have developed prototype workflow executor functions using AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions, coupled with the HyperFlow workflow engine. These functions can run workflow tasks in AWS and Google infrastructures, and feature such capabilities as data staging to/from S3 or Google Cloud Storage and execution of custom application binaries. We have successfully deployed and executed the Montage astronomy workflow, often used as a benchmark, and we report on initial results of its performance evaluation. Our findings indicate that the simple mode of operation makes this approach easy to use, although there are costs involved in preparing portable application binaries for execution in a remote environment. While our solution is an early prototype, we find the presented approach highly promising. We also discuss possible future steps related to execution of scientific workflows in serverless infrastructures. Finally, we perform a cost analysis and discuss implications with regard to resource management for scientific applications in general.},

However, they limit application ﬂexibility and are expensive to use. We show that these specialized orchestration services are unnecessary. Instead, application-level orchestration, deployed as a library, can support the same programming interfaces, complex interactions and execution guarantees, utilizing only basic serverless components that are already universally supported and billed at a ﬁne-grained per-use basis. Furthermore, application-level orchestration affords applications more ﬂexibility and reduces costs for both providers and users. To demonstrate this, we present Unum, an application-level serverless orchestration system. Unum introduces an intermediate representation that partitions higher-level application deﬁnitions at compile-time and provides orchestration as a runtime library that executes in-situ with user-deﬁned FaaS functions. On unmodiﬁed serverless infrastructures, Unum functions coordinate and ensure correctness in a decentralized manner by leveraging strongly consistent data stores.},

A serverless application is a set of stateless functions, along with the events that should trigger their activation. A serverless runtime allocates resources as events arrive, avoiding the need for costly pre-allocated or dedicated hardware. While an attractive economic proposition, serverless computing currently lags behind the state of the art when it comes to function composition. This paper addresses the challenge of programming a composition of functions, where the composition is itself a serverless function. We demonstrate that engineering function composition into a serverless application is possible, but requires a careful evaluation of trade-offs. To help in evaluating these tradeoffs, we identify three competing constraints: functions should be considered as black boxes; function composition should obey a substitution principle with respect to synchronous invocation; and invocations should not be double-billed.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) workflows are extremely complex. The typical workflow consists of distinct stages of user interaction, such as preprocessing, training, and tuning, that are repeatedly executed by users but have heterogeneous computational requirements. This complexity makes it challenging for ML users to correctly provision and manage resources and, in practice, constitutes a significant burden that frequently causes over-provisioning and impairs user productivity. Serverless computing is a compelling model to address the resource management problem, in general, but there are numerous challenges to adopt it for existing ML frameworks due to significant restrictions on local resources.},

	abstract = {The serverless computing paradigm promises many desirable properties for cloud applications - low-cost, fine-grained deployment, and management-free operation. Consequently, the paradigm has underwent rapid growth: there currently exist tens of serverless platforms and all global cloud providers host serverless operations. To help tune existing platforms, guide the design of new serverless approaches, and overall contribute to understanding this paradigm, in this work we present a long-term, comprehensive effort to identify, collect, and characterize 89 serverless use cases. We survey use cases, sourced from white and grey literature, and from consultations with experts in areas such as scientific computing. We study each use case using 24 characteristics, including general aspects, but also workload, application, and requirements. When the use cases employ workflows, we further analyze their characteristics. Overall, we hope our study will be useful for both academia and industry, and encourage the community to further share and communicate their use cases.

While distributed computation frameworks have moved beyond a simple map-reduce model, many users are still left to struggle with complex cluster management and conﬁguration tools, even for running simple embarrassingly parallel jobs. We argue that stateless functions represent a viable platform for these users, eliminating cluster management overhead, fulﬁlling the promise of elasticity. Furthermore, using our prototype implementation, PyWren, we show that this model is general enough to implement a number of distributed computing models, such as BSP, efﬁciently. Extrapolating from recent trends in network bandwidth and the advent of disaggregated storage, we suggest that stateless functions are a natural ﬁt for data processing in future computing environments.},

	abstract = {Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is an event-based reactive programming model where functions run in ephemeral stateless containers for short duration. For building complex serverless applications, function composition is crucial to coordinate and synchronize the workflow of an application. Some serverless orchestration systems exist, but they are in their primitive state and do not provide inherent support for non-trivial workflows like, Fork-Join. To address this gap, we propose a fully serverless and scalable design model ReactiveFnJ for Fork-Join workflow. The intent of this work is to illustrate a design which is completely choreographed, reactive, asynchronous, and represents a dynamic composition model for serverless applications based on Fork-Join workflow. Our design uses two innovative patterns, namely, Relay Composition and Master-Worker Composition to solve execution time-out challenges. As a Proof-of-Concept (PoC), the prototypical implementation of Split-Sort-Merge use case, based on Fork-Join workflow is discussed and evaluated. The ReactiveFnJ handles embarrassingly parallel computations, and its design does not depend on any external orchestration services, messaging services, and queue services. ReactiveFnJ facilitates in designing fully automated pipelines for distributed data processing systems, satisfying the Serverless Trilemma in true essence. A file of any size can be processed using our effective and extensible design without facing execution time-out challenges. The proposed model is generic and can be applied to a wide range of serverless applications that are based on the Fork-Join workflow pattern. It fosters the choreographed serverless composition for complex workflows. The proposed design model is useful for software engineers and developers in industry and commercial organizations, total solution vendors and academic researchers.},

Companies are increasingly adopting Serverless, by migrating existing applications to this new paradigm. Different practitioners proposed patterns for composing and managing serverless functions. However, some of these patterns offer different solutions to solve the same problem, which makes it hard to select the most suitable solution for each problem. [Goal] In this work, we aim at supporting practitioners in understanding the different patterns, by classifying them and reporting possible beneﬁts and issues. [Method] We adopted a multivocal literature review process, surveying peer-reviewed and grey literature and classifying patterns (common solutions to solve common problems), together with beneﬁts and issues. [Results] Among 24 selected works, we identiﬁed 32 patterns that we classiﬁed as orchestration, aggregation, event-management, availability, communication, and authorization. [Conclusion] Practitioners proposed a list of fairly consistent patterns, even if a small number of patterns proposed different solutions to similar problems. Some patterns emerged to circumvent some serverless limitations, while others for some classical technical problems (e.g. publisher/subscriber).},

In this paper, we propose tinyFaaS, a new FaaS system that is specifically designed for edge environments and their unique challenges. Our platform is lightweight enough to run on low-performance single machine edge nodes, provides a CoAP endpoint to support communication with low-power devices, and uses Docker containers to isolate tenants. We evaluate tinyFaaS through a proof-of-concept implementation that we benchmark and compare to state-of-the-art FaaS platforms.

While cloud providers usually offer composition services for such workflows, they do not support cross-platform workflows forcing developers to hardcode the composition logic. Furthermore, FaaS workflows tend to be slow due to cascading cold starts, inter-function latency, and data download latency on the critical path. In this paper, we propose GEOFF, a serverless choreography middleware that executes FaaS workflows across different public and private FaaS platforms, including ad-hoc workflow recomposition. Furthermore, GEOFF supports function pre-warming and data pre-fetching. This minimizes end-to-end workflow latency by taking cold starts and data download latency off the critical path. In experiments with our proof-of-concept prototype and a realistic application, we were able to reduce end-to-end latency by more than 50\%.},

	abstract = {Function as a Service (FaaS) has been gaining popularity as a way to deploy computations to serverless backends in the cloud. This paradigm shifts the complexity of allocating and provisioning resources to the cloud provider, which has to provide the illusion of always-available resources (i.e., fast function invocations without cold starts) at the lowest possible resource cost. Doing so requires the provider to deeply understand the characteristics of the FaaS workload. Unfortunately, there has been little to no public information on these characteristics. Thus, in this paper, we ﬁrst characterize the entire production FaaS workload of Azure Functions. We show for example that most functions are invoked very infrequently, but there is an 8-order-of-magnitude range of invocation frequencies. Using observations from our characterization, we then propose a practical resource management policy that signiﬁcantly reduces the number of function cold starts, while spending fewer resources than state-of-the-practice policies.},

We analyze 16 characteristics that describe why and when successful adopters are using serverless applications, and how they are building them. We further compare the results of our characterization study to 10 existing, mostly industrial, studies and datasets; this allows us to identify points of consensus across multiple studies, investigate points of disagreement, and overall confirm the validity of our results.

	abstract = {The appeal of serverless (FaaS) has triggered a growing interest on how to use it in data-intensive applications such as ETL, query processing, or machine learning (ML). Several systems exist for training large-scale ML models on top of serverless infrastructures (e.g., AWS Lambda) but with inconclusive results in terms of their performance and relative advantage over “serverful” infrastructures (IaaS). In this paper we present a systematic, comparative study of distributed ML training over FaaS and IaaS. We present a design space covering design choices such as optimization algorithms and synchronization protocols, and implement a platform, LambdaML, that enables a fair comparison between FaaS and IaaS. We present experimental results using LambdaML, and further develop an analytic model to capture cost/performance tradeoffs that must be considered when opting for a serverless infrastructure. Our results indicate that ML training pays off in serverless only for models with efficient (i.e., reduced) communication and that quickly converge. In general, FaaS can be much faster but it is never significantly cheaper than IaaS.},

	abstract = {Serverless computing is poised to fulﬁll the long-held promise of transparent elasticity and millisecond-level pricing. To achieve this goal, service providers impose a ﬁnegrained computational model where every function has a maximum duration, a ﬁxed amount of memory and no persistent local storage. We observe that the ﬁne-grained elasticity of serverless is key to achieve high utilization for general computations such as analytics workloads, but that resource limits make it challenging to implement such applications as they need to move large amounts of data between functions that don’t overlap in time. In this paper, we present Locus, a serverless analytics system that judiciously combines (1) cheap but slow storage with (2) fast but expensive storage, to achieve good performance while remaining cost-efﬁcient. Locus applies a performance model to guide users in selecting the type and the amount of storage to achieve the desired cost-performance trade-off. We evaluate Locus on a number of analytics applications including TPC-DS, CloudSort, Big Data Benchmark and show that Locus can navigate the costperformance trade-off, leading to 4⇥-500⇥ performance improvements over slow storage-only baseline and reducing resource usage by up to 59\% while achieving comparable performance with running Apache Spark on a cluster of virtual machines, and within 2⇥ slower compared to Redshift.},

	abstract = {Much like on-premises systems, the natural choice for running database analytics workloads in the cloud is to provision a cluster of nodes to run a database instance. However, analytics workloads are often bursty or low volume, leaving clusters idle much of the time, meaning customers pay for compute resources even when underutilized. The ability of cloud function services, such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, to run small, fine granularity tasks make them appear to be a natural choice for query processing in such settings. But implementing an analytics system on cloud functions comes with its own set of challenges. These include managing hundreds of tiny stateless resource-constrained workers, handling stragglers, and shuffling data through opaque cloud services. In this paper we present Starling, a query execution engine built on cloud function services that employs a number of techniques to mitigate these challenges, providing interactive query latency at a lower total cost than provisioned systems with low-to-moderate utilization. In particular, on a 1TB TPC-H dataset in cloud storage, Starling is less expensive than the best provisioned systems for workloads when queries arrive 1 minute apart or more. Starling also has lower latency than competing systems reading from cloud object stores and can scale to larger datasets.},

However, for distributed jobs that benefit from largescale and dynamic parallelism, the lack of fast and cheap communication is a major limitation. Individual functions cannot communicate directly, group operations do not exist, and users resort to manual implementations of storage-based communication. This results in communication times multiple orders of magnitude slower than those found in HPC systems. We overcome this limitation and present the FaaS Message Interface (FMI). FMI is an easy-to-use, high-performance framework for general-purpose point-to-point and collective communication in FaaS applications. We support different communication channels and offer a model-driven channel selection according to performance and cost expectations. We model the interface after MPI and show that message passing can be integrated into serverless applications with minor changes, providing portable communication closer to that offered by high-performance systems. In our experiments, FMI can speed up communication for a distributed machine learning FaaS application by up to 162x, while simultaneously reducing cost by up to 397 times.},

However, these frameworks are inherently asynchronous, leaving the heavy burden of managing synchronization to applications’ developers, which further signiﬁcantly restricts their usabilities. In this study, we propose a trigger-based incremental computing framework in the cloud, called Domino, with both synchronous and asynchronous mechanisms to coordinate parallel triggers.

Serverless offers improved programmability for customers, yet at the cost of increased design complexity for cloud providers. One such challenge is effective and consistent resource management for serverless platforms, the implications of which we explore in this paper. In this paper, we conduct one of the first detailed in situ measurement studies of performance variability in AWS Lambda. We show that the observed variations in performance are not only significant, but stable enough to exploit. We then design and evaluate an end-to-end system that takes advantage of this resource variability to exploit the FaaS consumption-based pricing model, in which functions are charged based on their fine-grain execution time rather than actual low-level resource consumption. By using both light-weight resource probing and function execution times to identify attractive servers in serverless platforms, customers of FaaS services can cause their functions to execute on better performing servers and realize a cost savings of up to 13\% in the same AWS region.},

Such an inefficiency has cascading negative impacts: longer startup times, lower throughput, higher latency, and higher cost. To mitigate these problems, we have built Photons, a framework leveraging workload parallelism to co-locate multiple instances of the same function within the same runtime. Concurrent invocations can then share the runtime and application state transparently, without compromising execution safety. Photons reduce function’s memory consumption by 25\% to 98\% per invocation, with no performance degradation compared to today’s serverless platforms. We also show that our approach can reduce the overall memory utilization by 30\%, and the total number of cold starts by 52\%.},

Current FaaS oﬀerings are targeted at stateless functions that do minimal I/O and communication. We argue that the beneﬁts of serverless computing can be extended to a broader range of applications and algorithms while maintaining the key beneﬁts of existing FaaS oﬀerings. We present the design and implementation of Cloudburst, a stateful FaaS platform that provides familiar Python programming with low-latency mutable state and communication, while maintaining the autoscaling beneﬁts of serverless computing. Cloudburst accomplishes this by leveraging Anna, an autoscaling key-value store, for state sharing and overlay routing combined with mutable caches co-located with function executors for data locality. Performant cache consistency emerges as a key challenge in this architecture. To this end, Cloudburst provides a combination of lattice-encapsulated state and new deﬁnitions and protocols for distributed session consistency. Empirical results on benchmarks and diverse applications show that Cloudburst makes stateful functions practical, reducing the state-management overheads of current FaaS platforms by orders of magnitude while also improving the state of the art in serverless consistency.},

	abstract = {Serverless computing is an excellent ﬁt for big data processing because it can scale quickly and cheaply to thousands of parallel functions. Existing serverless platforms isolate functions in ephemeral, stateless containers, preventing them from directly sharing memory. This forces users to duplicate and serialise data repeatedly, adding unnecessary performance and resource costs. We believe that a new lightweight isolation approach is needed, which supports sharing memory directly between functions and reduces resource overheads. We introduce Faaslets, a new isolation abstraction for highperformance serverless computing. Faaslets isolate the memory of executed functions using software-fault isolation (SFI), as provided by WebAssembly, while allowing memory regions to be shared between functions in the same address space. Faaslets can thus avoid expensive data movement when functions are co-located on the same machine. Our runtime for Faaslets, FAASM, isolates other resources, e.g. CPU and network, using standard Linux cgroups, and provides a low-level POSIX host interface for networking, ﬁle system access and dynamic loading. To reduce initialisation times, FAASM restores Faaslets from already-initialised snapshots. We compare FAASM to a standard container-based platform and show that, when training a machine learning model, it achieves a 2× speed-up with 10× less memory; for serving machine learning inference, FAASM doubles the throughput and reduces tail latency by 90\%.},

Although appealing for applications with good parallelism and dynamic workload, this paper shows that it is non-trivial to adapt existing monolithic applications (like web services) to FaaS due to their complexity. To bridge the gap between complicated web services and FaaS, this paper proposes a runtime-based Semi-FaaS execution model, which dynamically extracts time-consuming code snippets (closures) from applications and offloads them to FaaS platforms for execution. It further proposes BeeHive, an offloading framework for Semi-FaaS, which relies on the managed runtime to provide a fallback-based execution model and addresses the performance issues in traditional offloading mechanisms for FaaS. Meanwhile, the runtime system of BeeHive selects offloading candidates in a user-transparent way and supports efficient object sharing, memory management, and failure recovery in a distributed environment. The evaluation using various web applications suggests that the Semi-FaaS execution supported by BeeHive can reach sub-second resource provisioning on commercialized FaaS platforms like AWS Lambda, which is up to two orders of magnitude better than other alternative scaling approaches in cloud computing.},

In this paper, we examine implications of using different methods to orchestrate the control flow of a serverless data processing pipeline composed as a set of independent FaaS functions. We performed experiments on the AWS Lambda FaaS platform and compared how four different patterns of control flow impact the cost and performance of the pipeline. We investigate control flow using client orchestration, microservice controllers, event-based triggers, and state-machines. Overall, we found that asynchronous methods led to lower orchestration costs, and that event-based orchestration incurred a performance penalty.},

However, the control-flow paradigm inherently results in long response latency, due to the heavy data persistence overhead, sequential resource usage, and late function triggering. Our investigation shows that the data-flow paradigm has the potential to resolve the above problems, with careful design and optimization. We propose DataFlower, a scheme that achieves the data-flow paradigm for serverless workflows. In DataFlower, a container is abstracted to be a function logic unit and a data logic unit. The function logic unit runs the functions, and the data logic unit handles the data transmission asynchronously. Moreover, a host-container collaborative communication mechanism is used to support efficient data transfer. Our experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art serverless designs, DataFlower reduces the 99\%-ile latency of the benchmarks by up to 35.4\%, and improves the peak throughput by up to 3.8X.},

	abstract = {Serverless computing offers a scalable event-based paradigm for deploying managed cloud-native applications. Function triggers are essential building blocks in serverless, as they initiate any function execution. However, function triggering is insufficiently studied and inherently hard to measure given the distributed, ephemeral, and asynchronous nature of event-based function coordination. To address this gap, we present TriggerBench, a cross-provider benchmark for evaluating serverless function triggers based on distributed tracing. We evaluate the trigger latency (i.e., time to transition between two functions) of eight types of triggers in Microsoft Azure and three in AWS. Our results show that all triggers suffer from long tail latency, storage triggers introduce variable multi-second delays, and HTTP triggers are most suitable for interactive applications. Our insights can guide developers in choosing optimal event or messaging triggers for latency-sensitive applications. Researchers can extend TriggerBench to study the latency, scalability, and reliability of further trigger types and cloud providers.},

Boki shared logs enable stateful serverless applications to manage their state with durability, consistency, and fault tolerance. Boki shared logs achieve high throughput and low latency. The key enabler is the metalog, a novel mechanism that allows Boki to address ordering, consistency and fault tolerance independently. The metalog orders shared log records with high throughput and it provides read consistency while allowing service providers to optimize the write and read path of the shared log in different ways. To demonstrate the value of shared logs for stateful serverless applications, we build Boki support libraries that implement fault-tolerant workflows, durable object storage, and message queues. Our evaluation shows that shared logs can speed up important serverless workloads by up to 4.7×.},

This paper takes a look at the fundamental distinguishing attributes of serverless functions, and shows how some of them make energy-efficiency challenging. The programming model and deployment requirements of serverless functions makes them terribly energy inefficient—consuming more than 15× energy compared to conventional web services. On the bright side, FaaS is still actively expanding, and there is also an opportunity for rethinking FaaS resource management and deployment models, and make carbon efficiency a primary consideration. We present a few such techniques: moving functions to energy-friendly locations in distributed edge clouds; machine learning based modeling and control; and function-level demand response that combines ideas from approximate computing. Together, these represent a possible path forward to making serverless cloud computing sustainable. CCS Concepts: • Hardware → Enterprise level and data centers power issues; • Software and its engineering → Power management; • Computer systems organization → Cloud computing; Embedded systems; Redundancy; Robotics; • Networks → Network reliability.},

These new approaches must enable computation to be mobile, so that, for example, it can occur near data, be triggered by events (e.g., arrival of new data), be offloaded to specialized accelerators, or run remotely where resources are available. They also require new design approaches in which monolithic applications can be decomposed into smaller components, that may in turn be executed separately and on the most suitable resources. To address these needs we present funcX—a distributed function as a service (FaaS) platform that enables flexible, scalable, and high performance remote function execution. funcX’s endpoint software can transform existing clouds, clusters, and supercomputers into function serving systems, while funcX’s cloud-hosted service provides transparent, secure, and reliable function execution across a federated ecosystem of endpoints. We motivate the need for funcX with several scientific case studies, present our prototype design and implementation, show optimizations that deliver throughput in excess of 1 million functions per second, and demonstrate, via experiments on two supercomputers, that funcX can scale to more than more than 130 000 concurrent workers.},

We explain how the platforms isolate the functions of different accounts, using either virtual machines or containers, which has important security implications. We characterize performance in terms of scalability, coldstart latency, and resource efﬁciency, with highlights including that AWS Lambda adopts a bin-packing-like strategy to maximize VM memory utilization, that severe contention between functions can arise in AWS and Azure, and that Google had bugs that allow customers to use resources for free.},

However, the serverless provider still needs to provision, manage, and pay the IaaS provider for the virtual machines (VMs) hosting its platform. This ties the cost of the serverless platform to the cost of the underlying VMs. One way to significantly reduce cost is to use spare resources, which cloud providers rent at a massive discount. Harvest VMs offer such cheap resources: they grow and shrink to harvest all the unallocated CPU cores in their host servers, but may be evicted to make room for more expensive VMs. Thus, using Harvest VMs to run the serverless platform comes with two main challenges that must be carefully managed: VM evictions and dynamically varying resources in each VM.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming increasingly prevalent in our environment, yet the process of programming these devices and processing the data they produce remains difficult. Typically, data is processed on device, involving arduous work in low level languages, or data is moved to the cloud, where abundant resources are available for Functions as a Service (FaaS) or other handlers. FaaS is an emerging category of flexible computing services, where developers deploy self-contained functions to be run in portable and secure containerized environments; however, at the moment, these functions are limited to running in the cloud or in some cases at the “edge” of the network using resource rich, Linux-based systems.In this paper, we present NanoLambda, a portable platform that brings FaaS, high-level language programming, and familiar cloud service APIs to non-Linux and microcontroller-based IoT devices. To enable this, NanoLambda couples a new, minimal Python runtime system that we have designed for the least capable end of the IoT device spectrum, with API compatibility for AWS Lambda and S3. NanoLambda transfers functions between IoT devices (sensors, edge, cloud), providing power and latency savings while retaining the programmer productivity benefits of high-level languages and FaaS. A key feature of NanoLambda is a scheduler that intelligently places function executions across multi-scale IoT deployments according to resource availability and power constraints. We evaluate a range of applications that use NanoLambda to run on devices as small as the ESP8266 with 64KB of ram and 512KB flash storage.},

To achieve this, we conduct an experiment in which we implement four prevalent yet intentionally simple serverless use cases and manually migrate them across three popular commercial cloud providers. The results show that even when migrating simple use cases, developers encounter multiple aspects of a lock-in problem.

Given that data centers are energy-intensive enterprises, estimated to account for around 1\% of worldwide electricity use, these trends have clear implications for global energy demand and must be analyzed rigorously. Several oft-cited yet simplistic analyses claim that the energy used by the world's data centers has doubled over the past decade and that their energy use will triple or even quadruple within the next decade (

But such extrapolations based on recent service demand growth indicators overlook strong countervailing energy efficiency trends that have occurred in parallel (see the first figure). Here, we integrate new data from different sources that have emerged recently and suggest more modest growth in global data center energy use (see the second figure). This provides policy-makers and energy analysts a recalibrated understanding of global data center energy use, its drivers, and near-term efficiency potential.},

	abstract = {Lambda paradigm, also known as Function as a Service (FaaS), is a novel event-driven concept that allows companies to build scalable and reliable enterprise applications in an off-premise computing data-center as a serverless solution. In practice, however, an important goal for the service provider of a Lambda platform is to devise an efficient way to consolidate multiple Lambda functions in a single host. While the majority of existing resource management solutions use only operating-system level metrics (e.g., average utilization of computing and I/O resources) to allocate the available resources among the submitted workloads in a balanced way, a resource allocation schema that is oblivious to the issue of shared-resource contention can result in a significant performance variability and degradation within the entire platform. This paper proposes a predictive controller scheme that dynamically allocates resources in a Lambda platform. This scheme uses a prediction tool to estimate the future rate of every event stream and takes into account the quality of service enforcements requested by the owner of each Lambda function. This is formulated as an optimization problem where a set of cost functions are introduced (i) to reduce the total QoS violation incidents; (ii) to keep the CPU utilization level within an accepted range; and (iii) to avoid the fierce contention among collocated applications for obtaining shared resources. Performance evaluation is carried out by comparing the proposed solution with an enhanced interference-aware version of three well-known heuristics, namely spread, binpack (the two native clustering solutions employed by Docker Swarm) and best-effort resource allocation schema. Experimental results show that the proposed controller improves the overall performance (in terms of reducing the end-to-end response time) by 14.9 percent on average compared to the best result of the other heuristics. The proposed solution also increases the overall CPU utilization by 18 percent on average (for lightweight workloads), while achieves an average 87 percent (maximum 146 percent) improvement in preventing QoS violation incidents.},

	abstract = {Cloud platforms’ growing energy demand and carbon emissions are raising concern about their environmental sustainability. The current approach to enabling sustainable clouds focuses on improving energy-e�ciency and purchasing carbon o�sets. These approaches have limits: many cloud data centers already operate near peak e�ciency, and carbon o�sets cannot scale to near zero carbon where there is little carbon left to o�set. Instead, enabling sustainable clouds will require applications to adapt to when and where unreliable low-carbon energy is available. Applications cannot do this today because their energy use and carbon emissions are not visible to them, as the energy system provides the rigid abstraction of a continuous, reliable energy supply. This vision paper instead advocates for a “carbon �rst” approach to cloud design that elevates carbon-e�ciency to a �rst-class metric. To do so, we argue that cloud platforms should virtualize the energy system by exposing visibility into, and software-de�ned control of, it to applications, enabling them to de�ne their own abstractions for managing energy and carbon emissions based on their own requirements.},

	abstract = {Serverless computing platforms allow developers to host singlepurpose applications that automatically scale with demand. In contrast to traditional long-running applications on dedicated, virtualized, or container-based platforms, serverless applications are intended to be instantiated when called, execute a single function, and shut down when finished. State-of-the-art serverless platforms achieve these goals by creating a new container instance to host a function when it is called and destroying the container when it completes. This design allows for cost and resource savings when hosting simple applications, such as those supporting IoT devices at the edge of the network. However, the use of containers introduces some overhead which may be unsuitable for applications requiring low-latency response or hardware platforms with limited resources, such as those served by edge computing environments. In this paper, we present a nomenclature for characterizing serverless function access patterns which allows us to derive the basic requirements of a serverless computing runtime. We then propose the use of WebAssembly as an alternative method for running serverless applications while meeting these requirements. Finally, we demonstrate how a WebAssembly-based serverless platform provides many of the same isolation and performance guarantees of container-based platforms while reducing average application start times and the resources needed to host them.},

Our analysis spans workloads from five data centers. We focus on cold starts and provide a comprehensive examination of the underlying factors influencing the number and duration of cold starts. These factors include trigger types, request synchronicity, runtime languages, and function resource allocations. We investigate components of cold starts, including pod allocation time, code and dependency deployment time, and scheduling delays, and examine their relationships with runtime languages, trigger types, and resource allocation. We introduce pod utility ratio to measure the pod’s useful lifetime relative to its cold start time, giving a more complete picture of cold starts, and see that some pods with long cold start times have longer useful lifetimes. Our findings reveal the complexity and multifaceted origins of the number, duration, and characteristics of cold starts, driven by differences in trigger types, runtime languages, and function resource allocations. For example, cold starts in Region 1 take up to 7 seconds, dominated by dependency deployment time and scheduling. In Region 2, cold starts take up to 3 seconds and are dominated by pod allocation time. Based on this, we identify opportunities to reduce the number and duration of cold starts using strategies for multi-region scheduling. Finally, we suggest directions for future research to address these challenges and enhance the performance of serverless cloud platforms.},

The second trace is a representative workload from Huawei’s public FaaS platform. This trace contains per-minute arrival rates for over 5000 functions running in a single Huawei data center. We present the internals of a production FaaS platform by characterizing resource consumption, cold-start times, programming languages used, periodicity, per-second versus per-minute burstiness, correlations, and popularity. Our findings show that there is considerable diversity in how serverless functions behave: requests vary by up to 9 orders of magnitude across functions, with some functions executed over 1 billion times per day; scheduling time, execution time and cold-start distributions vary across 2 to 4 orders of magnitude and have very long tails; and function invocation counts demonstrate strong periodicity for many individual functions and on an aggregate level. Our analysis also highlights the need for further research in estimating resource reservations and time-series prediction to account for the huge diversity in how serverless functions behave.},

To ensure that the startup times of serverless functions do not discourage their use, resource providers need to keep these functions hot, often by passing in synthetic data. We describe the real power consumption characteristics of serverless, based on execution traces reported in the literature, and describe potential strategies (some adopted from existing VM and container-based approaches) that can be used to reduce the energy overheads of serverless execution. Our analysis is, purposefully, biased toward the use of machine learning workloads because: (1) workloads are increasingly being used widely across different applications; (2) functions that implement machine learning algorithms can range in complexity from long-running (deep learning) versus short-running (inference only), enabling us to consider serverless across a variety of possible execution behaviors. The general findings are easily translatable to other domains.},

	abstract = {Serverless edge computing is a specialized system design tailored for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It leverages serverless computing to minimize operational management and enhance resource efficiency, and utilizes the concept of edge computing to allow code execution near the data sources. However, edge devices powered by renewable energy face challenges due to energy input variability, resulting in imbalances in their operational availability. As a result, high-powered nodes may waste excess energy, while low-powered nodes may frequently experience unavailability, impacting system sustainability. Addressing this issue requires energy-aware resource schedulers, but existing cloud-native serverless frameworks are energy-agnostic. To overcome this, we propose an energy-aware scheduler for sustainable serverless edge systems. We introduce a reference architecture for such systems and formally model energy-aware resource scheduling, treating the function-to-node assignment as an imbalanced energy-minimizing assignment problem. We then design an optimal offline algorithm and propose faasHouse, an online energy-aware scheduling algorithm that utilizes resource sharing through computation offloading. Lastly, we evaluate faasHouse against benchmark algorithms using real-world renewable energy traces and a practical cluster of single-board computers managed by Kubernetes. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in balanced operational availability (by 46\%) and throughput (by 44\%) compared to the Kubernetes scheduler.},

	abstract = {While serverless computing is increasingly popular, its energy and power consumption behavior is hardly explored. In this work, we perform a thorough characterization of the serverless environment and observe that it poses a set of challenges not effectively handled by existing energy-management schemes. Short serverless functions execute in opaque virtualized sandboxes, are idle for a large fraction of their invocation time, context switch frequently, and are co-located in a highly dynamic manner with many other functions of diverse properties. These features are a radical shift from more traditional application environments and require a new approach to manage energy and power. Driven by these insights, we design EcoFaaS, the first energy management framework for serverless environments. EcoFaaS takes a user-provided end-to-end application Service Level Objective (SLO). It then splits the SLO into per-function deadlines that minimize the total energy consumption. Based on the computed deadlines, EcoFaaS sets the optimal per-invocation core frequency using a prediction algorithm. The algorithm performs a fine-grained analysis of the execution time of each invocation, while taking into account the specific invocation inputs. To maximize efficiency, EcoFaaS splits the cores in a server into multiple Core Pools, where all the cores in a pool run at the same frequency and are controlled by a single scheduler. EcoFaaS dynamically changes the sizes and frequencies of the pools based on the current system state. We implement EcoFaaS on two open-source serverless platforms (OpenWhisk and KNative) and evaluate it using diverse serverless applications. Compared to state-of-the-art energy-management systems, EcoFaaS reduces the total energy consumption of serverless clusters by 42 \% while simultaneously reducing the tail latency by 34.8 \%.},

	abstract = {With serverless computing, users develop scalable applications using lightweight functions as building blocks, while cloud providers own most of the computing stack, allowing for better resource optimizations. In this paper, we observe that modern server-class processors are inefficiently utilized in serverless environments. Cores perform frequent context switches within function invocations and have a high degree of oversubscription. In such an environment, functions frequently lose their micro-architectural state in stateful hardware structures like caches, TLBs, and branch predictors, causing performance degradation. At the same time, modern processors are dimensioned for the needs of a broad set of applications, rendering them suboptimal for serverless workloads. Based on these insights, we propose Mosaic, an architecture optimized for serverless environments that maintains generality to efficiently support other workloads. Mosaic has two components: (1) MosaicCPU, a processor architecture that efficiently runs both serverless workloads and traditional monolithic applications, and (2) MosaicScheduler, a software stack for serverless systems that maximizes the benefits of MosaicCPU. MosaicCPU slices micro-architectural structures into small chunks and assigns tiles of such chunks to functions. The processor retains the state of functions in their tiles across context switches, thereby improving performance. Furthermore, currently-inactive tiles are set to a low power mode, thereby reducing energy consumption. In addition, MosaicScheduler maximizes efficiency by introducing predictive right-sizing of the per-function tiles, alongside with smart scheduling based on the state of the tiles. Overall, compared to conventional server-class processors, Mosaic improves the throughput of serverless workloads by 225\% while using 22\% less power.},

While prior work has primarily focused on optimizing performance, this paper focuses on reducing the carbon footprint of these systems making variations in grid carbon intensity and intermittency from renewables transparent to the user. We introduce GreenWhisk, a carbon-aware serverless computing platform built upon Apache OpenWhisk, operating in two modes - grid-connected and grid-isolated - addressing intermittency challenges arising from renewables and the grid’s carbon footprint. Moreover, we develop carbon-aware load balancing algorithms that leverage energy and carbon information to reduce the carbon footprint. Our evaluation results show that GreenWhisk can easily incorporate carbon-aware algorithms, thereby reducing the carbon footprint of functions without significantly impacting the performance of function execution.

As computing becomes increasingly ubiquitous, however, so does its environmental impact. This paper brings the issue to the attention of computer-systems researchers. Our analysis, built on industry-reported characterization, quantifies the environmental effects of computing in terms of carbon emissions. Broadly, carbon emissions have two sources: operational energy consumption, and hardware manufacturing and infrastructure. Although carbon emissions from the former are decreasing thanks to algorithmic, software, and hardware innovations that boost performance and power efficiency, the overall carbon footprint of computer systems continues to grow. This work quantifies the carbon output of computer systems to show that most emissions related to modern mobile and data-center equipment come from hardware manufacturing and infrastructure. We therefore outline future directions for minimizing the environmental impact of computing systems.},

However, low resource utilization in modern datacenters brings huge wastes of hardware resources and infrastructure investment. To improve resource utilization, a straightforward way is co-locating different workloads on the same hardware. To figure out the resource efficiency and understand the key characteristics of workloads in co-located cluster, we analyze an 8-day trace from Alibaba's production trace. We reveal three key findings as follows. First, memory becomes the new bottleneck and limits the resource efficiency in Alibaba's datacenter. Second, in order to protect latency-critical applications, batch-processing applications are treated as second-class citizens and restricted to utilize limited resources. Third, more than 90\% of latency-critical applications are written in Java applications. Massive self-contained JVMs further complicate resource management and limit the resource efficiency in datacenters.},

This simplifies the interface for users to deploy serverless computations but creates deployments that are resource inefficient. In this paper, we take a principled approach to the problem of resource allocation for serverless functions, analyzing the effects of automating this choice in a way that leads to the best combination of performance and cost. In particular, we systematically explore the opportunities that come with decoupling memory and CPU resource allocations and also enabling the use of different VM types, and we find a rich trade-off space between performance and cost. The provider can use this in a number of ways, e.g., exposing all these parameters to the user; eliding preferences for performance and cost from users and simply offer the same performance with lower cost; or exposing a small number of choices for users to trade performance for cost.},

	abstract = {Sustainability in computing is critical as environmental concerns rise. The cloud industry’s carbon footprint is significant and rapidly growing. We show that dynamic geospatial shifting of cloud workloads to regions with lower carbon emission energy sources, particularly for more portable cloud workloads such as serverless applications, has a high potential to lower operational carbon emissions. To make the case, we build a comprehensive framework called Caribou that offloads serverless workflows across geo-distributed regions. Caribou requires no change in the application logic, nor on the provider side. It dynamically determines the best deployment plans, automatically (re-) deploys functions to appropriate regions, and redirects traffic to new endpoints. In reducing operational carbon through fine-grained, function-level offloading, Caribou does not undermine standard metrics such as performance and cost. We show how this approach can reduce the carbon footprint by an average of 22.9\% to 66.6\% across the North American continent. We demonstrate how a detailed specification of location constraints (e.g., to ensure compliance of one stage) can allow emission reductions for workflows (e.g., by offloading other stages). By showcasing the feasibility of carbon-aware geospatial application deployment, Caribou aims to push the boundaries of system techniques available to curtail cloud carbon emissions and provide a framework for future research.},

	abstract = {Serverless computing has become a mainstream cloud computing paradigm due to its high scalability, ease of server management, and cost-effectiveness. With cloud data centers’ carbon footprint rising sharply, understanding and minimizing the carbon impact of serverless functions becomes crucial. The unique characteristics of serverless functions, such as event-driven invocation, pay-as-you-go billing model, short execution duration, ephemeral runtime, and opaque underlying infrastructure, pose challenges in effective carbon metering. In this paper, we argue that the current carbon estimation methodologies should be expanded for more accurate carbon accounting in serverless settings, and propose a usage and allocation-based carbon model that aligns with the context of serverless computing. We also articulate how current serverless systems and billing models do not make it financially attractive to prioritize sustainability for a broad class of users and developers. To solve this, we propose a new carbon-aware pricing model and evaluate its ability to incentivize sustainable practices for developers through better alignment of billing and carbon efficiency.},

This work proposes ACT, an architectural carbon footprint modeling framework, to enable carbon characterization and sustainability-driven early design space exploration. Using ACT we demonstrate optimizing hardware for carbon yields distinct solutions compared to optimizing for performance and efficiency.

In our evaluation, our prototype built on top of Nuclio can reduce request response latency and workflow duration while also preventing the system from being overloaded during load peaks.

We evaluated key metrics such as CPU, memory, disk usage, throughput, and latency under varying workloads, utilizing a testbed of Intel NUCs and Raspberry Pi devices. Our results demonstrate significant differences in performance: k3s exhibited the lowest resource consumption, while k0s and k8s excelled in data plane throughput and latency. Under heavy stress scenarios, k3s and k0s accomplished the same workloads faster than the other distributions. OpenYurt offered balanced performance, suitable for hybrid cloud-edge use cases, but was less efficient in terms of resource usage and scalability compared to k0s, k3s and k8s. KubeEdge, although feature-rich for edge environments, exhibited higher resource consumption and lower scalability. These findings offer valuable insights for developers and operators selecting appropriate KD based on specific performance and resource efficiency requirements for edge computing environments.},

Therefore, managing applications on the low-Earth orbit edge will require the right platform abstractions.},

	abstract = {Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a promising paradigm for applications distributed across the edge-cloud continuum. FaaS functions are stateless by nature, leading to high elasticity and transparent invocation. Supporting stateful applications, however, requires integrating data storage in FaaS, which is not trivial in an edge-cloud environment. We propose Enoki, an architecture for stateful FaaS computing replicated across the edge-cloud continuum. Enoki integrates a replicated key-value store with single-node FaaS systems at edge and cloud nodes in order to provide low-latency local data access for functions without breaking the abstraction of the FaaS programming model. We evaluate Enoki with microbenchmarks on an open-source prototype and demonstrate building a stateful FaaS application with multiple functions distributed over edge and cloud.},

	abstract = {We design, implement, and evaluate 𝑌𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑅𝑜𝑛𝑔, the first production general-purpose serverless platform with a unified programming interface, multi-language runtime, and a distributed computing kernel for cloud-based applications. YuanRong addresses many limitations of existing Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) systems, particularly in performance and lack of important features. First, our fast function system supports sub-millisecond function invocation and localityaware hierarchical scheduling. Second, our multi-semantic built-in data system achieves object exchange latency of 200 microseconds, enabling end-to-end latency of 2 milliseconds for streaming elements at 5Gbps throughput. Third, the extensible, portable Service Bridge bridges stateless and stateful operations, allowing connection reuse and distributed transactions, and offers unified backend abstraction for multi-cloud portability. YuanRong has been deployed for over 3 years at Huawei across nearly 20 datacenter regions, processing up to 30 billion requests per day on more than 100,000 CPU cores, with a daily average CPU usage of 53\%. It serves various serverless workloads, including enhanced FaaS services, microservices, data analytics, deep model training and serving, and some HPC workloads. Our experience shows that Spring-based microservices can be migrated to YuanRong within one day, reducing resource costs by 90\%, demonstrating its generality and efficiency in supporting a broad spectrum of applications.},

This position paper proposes metrics that aim to measure the end-to-end sustainability footprint in data centers. To enable useful sustainable computing efforts, these metrics can track the sustainability footprint at various granularities—from a single request to an entire data center. The proposed metrics can also broadly influence sustainable computing practices by incentivizing end-users and developers to participate in sustainable computing efforts in data centers.
